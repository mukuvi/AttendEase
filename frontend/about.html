      <h2>About AttendEase</h2>
      <p>
        AttendEase is a student attendance management system that leverages
        facial recognition technology to make attendance marking faster and more
        accurate. By simply using a webcam, the system can automatically verify
        students as they register and attend classes. Our platform eliminates
        manual attendance marking, providing an easy and secure solution for
        managing class attendance.
