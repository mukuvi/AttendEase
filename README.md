# About AttendEase

**AttendEase** is a student attendance management system that leverages facial recognition technology to make attendance marking faster and more accurate. By simply using a webcam, the system can automatically verify students as they register and attend classes. Our platform eliminates manual attendance marking, providing an easy and secure solution for managing class attendance.

## Key Features of AttendEase:

- **Automatic Attendance Tracking**  
  Students are registered once, and the system verifies attendance by capturing their faces during the class.

- **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Lecturers can view the attendance status of their class in real time and see which students have attended.

- **Reports & Analytics**  
  Detailed reports on attendance history, percentage, and missed classes are generated automatically.
